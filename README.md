# Business Problem Statement
Maverik is a leading convenience and fuel store brand known for providing an excellent customer experience and specialized ‘BonFire’ food. Maverik also strengthens their communities by impacting local hunger, education, and outdoor enrichment. Maverik, founded in 1928, has grown to 8000 employees and 400 locations. Opening 30 stores each year, Maverik faces the unique challenge of forecasting and evaluating first-year sales performance expectations for each new location. Insufficient historical data, complex sales predictors, varying trends, and market fluctuations complicate interpreting and modeling efforts. The benefit of the solution is that an accurate forecasting model will enable Maverik to improve financial planning and may provide more accurate initial ROI documentation. A successful model will yield cost-effective predictions that are comparatively accurate to Maverik’s existing predictive models. Specific metrics may include Adjusted R Squared, Root Mean Square Errors (RMSE), or other values determined by Maverik.
# Groups Solution
We will use store-level data provided by Maverik and macroeconomic indicators with precise metrics determined later to develop a time series model to forecast store, food, gasoline, and diesel sales performance metrics for both individual and aggregate time intervals. The scope will meet several time-certain milestones. The team will perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) by October 1st. The team will then evaluate several analytics approaches; including autoregression, weighted moving averages, vector autoregression (VAR), autoregressive integrated moving averages (ARIMA), neural networks, and simulation to determine which are most appropriate for the given dataset. The team will then develop the model using the R programming language. By combining time series forecasting with simulation, the final model’s performance can be validated against simulated data to assess its robustness and allow the team to better understand the uncertainties associated with its forecasts. Due to the complexity of Maverik’s industry, the simulation will also help estimate the range of possible future outcomes and behavior of key variables, allowing the model to capture important interactions occurring within the data. The final product delivered will be the EDA results (including which factors contribute more to improved store performance) and the R script for the model. Automatic forecasting with new data exceeds this current scope of work, but the team will reevaluate this request as the models are constructed.
# My contribution
 I conducted an in-depth exploration and modeling of time series data, focusing on sales data, using LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) networks. My work began with a thorough exploratory data analysis to understand the underlying patterns and characteristics of the data. I then proceeded to normalize the data, an essential step for ensuring the effective performance of LSTM models. My approach involved preparing the data specifically for LSTM by creating sequences that represent a typical duration, reflective of the data's periodic nature. This setup was essential for capturing the temporal dependencies in the dataset.
The project's centerpiece was the development and training of a Sequential LSTM model. My model architecture included multiple LSTM layers, interspersed with dropout layers to mitigate overfitting, and concluded with a dense layer for output. The training process was carefully calibrated, balancing the number of epochs and batch size, and a portion of the data was set aside for validation purposes.
Upon training the model, I focused on evaluating its performance through various metrics, assessing how well the model predicted the trends in the data. Finally, I visually represented the model's predictions against the actual data, demonstrating its capability to closely follow the sales trends. Overall, this project not only enhanced my understanding of LSTM networks in time series analysis but also provided valuable insights into the dynamics of sales data.
# Business Value
Our goal was to develop an accurate forecasting model using store-level data provided by Maverik, along with macroeconomic indicators. This model aims to predict daily sales volumes for diesel, unleaded gasoline, inside-store sales, and food sales. Our approach included comprehensive exploratory data analysis, identifying key trends such as seasonality and the impact of holidays on sales. We also engaged in feature engineering to capture these trends and created several predictive models, with a final model focusing on variables significant in forecasting sales.
The successful implementation of this model offers Maverik significant business value. It improves their financial planning capabilities and provides more accurate initial ROI documentation for new stores. Our solution aims to yield cost-effective and accurate predictions, enhancing Maverik's ability to make informed decisions in its expansion strategy. This model's effectiveness will be measured using metrics such as Adjusted R Squared and Root Mean Square Errors (RMSE), aligning with Maverik's performance evaluation criteria. ​
# Difficulties that we faced
In our project, we encountered several challenges in forecasting first-year sales for new locations. The primary difficulty stemmed from insufficient historical data, as new stores lack extensive sales records. This limitation made it challenging to establish reliable predictive models. Additionally, the complex nature of sales predictors, encompassing various factors influencing customer behavior and sales trends, added to the complexity. Varying trends across different locations and times further complicated our analysis, requiring nuanced understanding and adaptation of models. Lastly, market fluctuations, unpredictable and varying across geographies, posed a significant challenge in creating a robust, universally applicable forecasting model.
# What I learned from the project
In this project, I learned the intricate balance between theoretical knowledge and its practical application in real-world scenarios. Tackling Maverik's challenge of forecasting sales for new locations, I realized the complexity of working with limited historical data and how it demands innovative approaches to model development. The project deepened my understanding of handling complex sales predictors and interpreting varying trends, which required a nuanced approach to data analysis. I also gained insights into adapting models to account for unpredictable market fluctuations, emphasizing the need for flexibility and resilience in modeling. Overall, this experience significantly enhanced my skills in data analytics and problem-solving, especially in a dynamic business context.
